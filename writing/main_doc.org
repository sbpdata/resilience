* Concept
Resilience has gotten a reputation of an academic 'buzzword of the times', which seems to have led --- much in the vein of sustainability of the 90s, it seems nigh impossible to write a paper without an introduction that first laments the vagueness of the term, its 'buzziness',  and suggests a clarification. So too here. 

We can think of the resilience concept in terms of the three questions popularized by cite:carpenter_metaphor_2001:
 - resilience to what?
 - resilience by what?
 - resilience  

Unfortunately, metaphors do not make for good operational instruments.
